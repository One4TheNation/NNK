#### MyProblem

0.Hey Sensei Caleb, I've tried everything to debug this code—manual inspection, debugging, and even resorting to AI as a last-ditch effort—and it's still not loading properly! Can you just help me get this thing running? Once it's up, can you explain what I did wrong here? I'm seriously stuck!

1.Does this coding structure meet the required standards, or does it need any changes?

2.Could you please verify that my .env file is correct?

3.Please leave any notes in section below so I can learn from them and refer back to them later. Thank you!
